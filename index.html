			<p>I am a second year PhD Student in 
				<a href="http://www.eecs.mit.edu/">Electrical Engineering and 
				Computer Science</a> at MIT and am part of the Programming and Computing group at 
				<a href="http://www.csail.mit.edu/">CSAIL</a>. Currently, I am advised by
				<a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/rinard/">Martin Rinard</a>. I completed my 
				undegraduate degree at UCLA and attained a dual degree in <a href="">Computer Science</a> and 
				<a href="">Computational Biology</a>. I am interested in approximate computation, security, 
				programming models and biology.

				<h4 class="section">Topaz</h4>
				<p>Topaz is a task-based language and runtime for developing programs to run on approximate computing platforms that may occasionally produce arbitrarily inaccurate results. The Topaz implementation maps tasks onto approximate machines and integrates results into the main computation, deploying a novel outlier detection and reliable reexecution mechanism to prevent unacceptably inaccurate results from corrupting the overall computation.</p>
				<h4 class="section">Chisel</h4>
				<p>Chisel is a system for reliability- and accuracy-aware optimization of approximate computational kernels 
				that run on approximate hardware platforms. Given a combined reliability and accuracy specification, 
				Chisel automatically selects approximate kernel operations to synthesize an approximate computation 
				that minimizes energy consumption while satisfying its reliability and accuracy specification.</p>

			<p>
				Magpie is a code reuse detection tool that, given a Java project, scans online repositories for similar 
				snippets of code. Magpie then communicates the results to the user through the code reuse summary and browser. This tool 
				was implemented as an Eclipse plugin.

			<p>
				<p><b>2011</b><br>
				The Matlab to <a href="">Habanero C</a> compiler cross-compiles a subset of the Matlab language to Habanero C. The compiler has 
				partial library function support and links generated applications with a parallelized math library comprised of
				<a href="">LaPack</a>, <a href="">Blas</a> and handwritten parallel code. The cross compiler also recognizes and optimizes for cross-cutting
				matrix operations. I conducted this research under <a href="">Jens Palsberg</a>'s mentorship as part of the <a>Center for
				Domain Specific Computing (CDSC)</a> undergraduate 
				research program.

			<h4 class="section"><img class="header-icon" src="images/bio-icon.png"></img>Thyroid Simulator</h4>
			<p>
				<p><b>2009</b><br>
				I wrote a partial differential equation simulator for the pediatric thyroid hormone model. The simulator handled upwards of
				eighty differential equations and supported time delayed state variables and discontinuous inputs. The thyroid
				model itself is a very stiff system and is challenging to simulate. This project was part of my Computational Biology 
				thesis.

				I interned in the San Diego corperate Research and Development office on project Neo for two consecutive summers. For my internship, I developed high throughput realtime neurological visualizations to facilitate in-browser monitering of simulations. I was one of the six interns awarded the Roberto Padovani scholarship and returned to continue my work a second year.

				I interned at the Razavi Newman Bioinformatics research laboratory at the Salk Institute under Dr. Gerard Manning for several summers. For my research,
				I annotated the paramecium kinome and used comparative genomics to draw conclusions about the evolution of certain kinase families in this species.
